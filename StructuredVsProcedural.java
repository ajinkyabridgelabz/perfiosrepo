Focus: Procedural programming focuses on procedures or functions, which are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
Control Flow: It uses a linear control flow, where instructions are executed sequentially from top to bottom. Conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while) are used for control flow.
Data: Data is typically organized in structures like arrays and structs. Functions manipulate these data structures.
Example: C, Pascal, and Fortran are some of the languages that primarily follow the procedural paradigm.

Structured Programming:

Focus: Structured programming is a subset of procedural programming that emphasizes the use of structured control flow constructs.
Control Flow: It promotes structured control flow constructs like loops and conditionals without the use of "goto" statements or unstructured jumps.
Modularity: Code is organized into modules or functions to promote reusability and maintainability.
Example: Languages like C and Pascal also support structured programming when adhering to certain coding guidelines.); "
